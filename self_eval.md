# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? I am feeling somewhat confident and continue to feel more confident with the more practice I get
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? I am feeling somewhat confident and continue to feel more confident with the more practice I get
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? I am feeling somewhat confident and continue to feel more confident with the more practice I get
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? Hard to say; I completed the mild and medium challenges right away and then switched to other assignments. I knew I wanted to complete the spicy challenge but wasn't sure how much time it would take and wanted to ensure I got the other assignments done before completing this "bonus" challenge. So I finished the bulk of the assignment quickly and circled back to complete the spicy challenge and these questions at the end. It didn't feel like it took took long once I got going. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? practice, practice, practice. Repetition is key so I will keep chugging along and will revisit this work before the next class
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? none right now but when I do have questions I can google and/or ask my small group
